1. [x] Come up with idea for project.
2. [x] Find a repository that you I can use as a template and take this from and also add things to.
3. [x] Fork the repository into my github.
4. [x] Add a license.
[x] Begin changing the data and the code to better fit our purpose:
    - Changed Excel data name from Car to House. Changed subject names, and columns into topics that are related to real estate, like type of house, # of bedrooms         and bathrooms.
    - Imported Stat Models, and the Metric Score in order to implement the code.
    - Preprocessed the data since it is important to have accurate results by looking for missing or null values; filling the missing value with 0. Fortunately, we       didn't have any null values in our data.
    - Check to see if we have any categorical value in our data table, and if so, then we need to change it to numerical values.
    - In Car data we had four columns that  had categorical value, but in House data we only have two so I converted columns “Type” and “Sold?” to numerical value         by using LabelEncoder.

 [x] Add a Readme to github.
 [x] Create the introduction powerpoint and add it to github.
